After earning my degree in molecular biology & neuroscience from Princeton, I worked in a lab researching glioblastoma, one of the most aggressive brain cancers. This hands-on experience, paired with 2.5 years in medical school, provided me with valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities within healthcare.\nRecognizing the transformative potential of data and technology, I transitioned into data science to address some of healthcare’s most pressing problems. Over the past four years, I’ve contributed to projects such as pharmacy management systems and tools designed to enhance patient outcomes. I thrive on uncovering insights, developing impactful models, and crafting innovative solutions to improve healthcare systems.\nOutside work, I enjoy decorating and painting, which allow me to explore creativity and self-expression. I also have a deep love for books that challenge my thinking and offer fresh perspectives, particularly science fiction and fantasy. Their imaginative worlds and thought-provoking themes inspire my curiosity and help me approach problems with new perspectives.\nI’d love to collaborate and contribute to driving positive change in the healthcare industry!\n\n\n\nSouthern Methodist University (2019)\nMS in Applied Statistics & Data Analytics\n\nNorthwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine (2014-2017)\nMD Candidate (Full-Tuition Scholarship Recipient)\n\nPrinceton University (2012)\nBA in Molecular Biology & Neuroscience"
